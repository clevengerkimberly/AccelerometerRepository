# Development of raw acceleration cut-points for wrist and hip accelerometers to assess sedentary behaviour and physical activity in 5–7-year-old children
### Crotti 2020

## Description
Three sets of cut-points for classifying physical activity intensity from Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) were generated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis for children wearing an ActiGraph on the right hip and each wrist. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 27.4 to 82.6% and 50.1 to 96.1%, respectively.

| *Activities*  |Playground free-play, overground walking/running, sports/exercise, stationary   |
| *Criterion* |Direct observation and compendium   |
| *Accelerometer(s)* |ActiGraph GT9X on right hip, each wrist   |

## Instructions
ENMO per 1-sec are calculated as square root of the sum of the squared acceleration in each axis, minus one, with negative values rounded up to zero. Below are the developed cut-points.
