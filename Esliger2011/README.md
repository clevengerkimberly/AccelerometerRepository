# Validation of the GENEA Accelerometer
### Esliger 2011
---

## Description
Three sets of cut-points for classifying physical activity intensity from signal magnitude vector (gravity subtracted) were generated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis for adults wearing GENEA monitors on the right hip and each wrist. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 73 to 99% and 56 to 99%, respectively.

## Instructions
Signal magnitude vector (gravity subtracted) per 1-min was calculated as square root of the sum of the squared acceleration in each axis, minus gravity. Below are the developed cut-points. However, as noted in the R package [GGIR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/vignettes/CutPoints.html), these cut-points are sensitive to sampling rate, so they provide a scaled version which can be applied to any raw acceleration data.
