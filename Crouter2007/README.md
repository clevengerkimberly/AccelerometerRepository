# A new 2-regression model for the Actical accelerometer
### Crouter 2007
---

## Description
A 2-regression method is presented in which hip-worn Actical counts/min and the coefficient of variation in counts/15-s over a minute are used to determine which of two equations is used to predict METs. This approach was developed in adults performing structured activities over a range of intensities. Mean bias was 0.1 METs and average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) across activities was 0.81 METs. This method has been updated in [Crouter, 2011](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/tree/main/Crouter2011).

## Instructions
Counts/min and the coefficient of variation (CV) for each minute (calculated using counts/15 s) are used to determine the correct equation for predicting METs.
