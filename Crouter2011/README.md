## Description
A 2-regression method is presented in which the counts/15-s and coefficient of variation of hip-worn Actical counts/15-s are used to determine METs. This approach was developed in adults performing structured activities over a range of intensities and cross-validated in an independent sample of adults in free-living. Bias was 8.78 (sedentary), 0.8 (light), and -9.6 (moderate-to-vigorous) minutes over the six-hour free-living observation period.

## Instructions
The coefficient of variation (CV) for each 15-second epoch and all possible combinations of the surrounding three 15-sec epochs is calculated. So, the CV is calculated for the 15-s epoch of interest and (1) the three preceding 15-s epochs, (2) the two preceding 15-s epochs and one 15-s epoch that followed, (3) the one preceding 15-s epoch before and the two 15-s that followed, and (4) the three 15-s epochs that followed. Then, the lowest CV for each 15-second epoch is used to determine the appropriate equation for predicting METs/min.
