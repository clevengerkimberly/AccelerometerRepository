# Calibration and Cross-validation of Accelerometry in Children and Adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis
### Bianchim 2022

## Description
Cut-points for Euclidean norm minus one (ENMO) and mean amplitude deviation (MAD) per 5-sec for monitors worn at the right hip and each wrist in children and adolescents with and without cystic fibrosis. Across device brands, wear locations, and samples, sensitivity was 80.8-99.0% and specificity was 57.6-86.2%.

## Development/Validation

|  |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| *Sample*  |Youth, 7-17 y, with cystic fibrosis (n=35; 20 males), or healthy controls (n=28, 12 males) |
| *Setting*  |Laboratory |
| *Activities*  |Games, stairs, stationary, walking   |
| *Criterion* |MetaMax Cortex 3B (VO2)   |
| *Accelerometer(s)* |ActiGraph GT9X on right hip and each wrist, GENEActiv on each wrist   |
| *Validation approach* |Leave-one-out cross-validation   |

## Instructions
ENMO per 5-sec is calculated as square root of the sum of the squared acceleration in each axis, minus one, with negative values rounded up to zero. MAD per 5-sec is calculated as the mean distance of data points about the mean. Below are the developed cut-points by sample (healthy versus with cystic fibrosis), wear location (hip, each wrist), and device brand (ActiGraph versus GENEActiv).
