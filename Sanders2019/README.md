# Evaluation of wrist and hip sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity raw acceleration cutpoints in older adults
### Sanders 2019

## Description
Cut-points for classifying physical activity intensity from Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) were generated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis in older, community-dwelling adults wearing GENEActiv and ActiGraph monitors on the non-dominant wrist and hip, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 43 to 94% and 65 to 99%, respectively.

## Instructions
ENMO was calculated per 1-sec following auto-calibration. Cut-points (below) were developed using the Youden index (maximizing sensitivity plus specificity) and by maximizing sensitivity for sedentary behavior, but specificity for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.
