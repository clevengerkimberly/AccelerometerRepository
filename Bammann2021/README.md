## Description
Cut-points for Euclidean norm minus one (ENMO) per 1-sec for monitors worn at each hip, wrist, and ankle in older adults (59-73 years of age). Across wear locations, R2 ranged from 0.08 to 0.59.

## Instructions
ENMO per 1-sec is calculated as square root of the sum of the squared acceleration in each axis, minus one, with negative values rounded up to zero. Below are the developed cut-points. You can also use the R package GGIR to calculate ENMO and apply these cut-points.
