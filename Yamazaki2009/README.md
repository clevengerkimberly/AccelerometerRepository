## Description
A model to predict oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) during walking was developed in adults in the laboratory and cross-validated in a sub-sample of participants on an outdoor trail. The model uses acceleration and vertical upward and downward speed, as determined by changes in barometric pressure, as inputs. Correlation between predicted and actual oxygen consumption was 0.879 with a mean difference of -0.2 mL/kg/min.

## Instructions
A model to predict oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) from vector magnitude (VM in g), vertical upward speed (Hu in m/min), and the vertical downward speed (Hd in m/min) is provided. VM is an integration of total acceleration (square root of the sum of the squared acceleration in each axis) for the period minus VM during rest. Hu and Hd were calculated either using an equation incorporating treadmill speed (m/min) and incline (%) (left) in the laboratory or using changes in device-measured barometric pressure in field-based observations (right).
