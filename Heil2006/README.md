# Predicting activity energy expenditure using the Actical® activity monitor

## Description
Single and 2-regression models for predicting activity energy expenditure in children and adults wearing an Actical accelerometer on the right hip or non-dominant ankle or wrist were developed. Twelve total models are presented- with all combinations of model type (single or 2-regression), sample (children or adults), and monitor wear location (wrist, ankle, hip). For children, overall mean differences compared to the criterion ranged from 1.3 (hip 2-regression) to 12.0 (ankle 2-regression) kcal/kg/min. For adults, differences were 7.1 (hip 2-regression) to 27.4 (ankle 2-regression) kcal/kg/min.

## Instructions
Actical counts/min are used as the input in to either single or 2-regression models to predict activity energy expenditure (kcal/kg/min). Separate models are available for children and adults and for each monitor wear location (ankle, hip, wrist).
