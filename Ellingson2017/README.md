## Description
This article compares four methods, three of which were previously published. The newly developed model is a modification of the Hildebrand et al. (2014) model and predicts oxygen consumption (VO2) using Euclidean Norm Minus One (ENMO) from an ActiGraph worn on the right wrist. Mean absolute percent error was 24.59 (overall), 23.39 (sedentary), 19.34 (light), 50.91 (moderate), and 3.45% (vigorous). Percent accuracy was 54.0% and sensitivity and specificity ranged from 37 to 98% and 60 to 99%, respectively.

## Instructions
Euclidean Norm Minus One (mg) is calculated as vector magnitude (square root of the sum of the squared acceleration in each axis) minus one (to account for gravity) and used in the below equation to predict VO2.
