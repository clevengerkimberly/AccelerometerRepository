Each model in the repository is evaluated based on the following framework which we describe in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6579/ac89c9/meta). This is modified from but based on the framework published by [Keadle et al. (2019)](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2019&issue=10000&article=00003&type=Fulltext) to evaluate devices that assess physical behavior. Phase designation is semi-arbitrary but this provides some indication of what can/needs to be done to further develop the model.

Phase 0 - Pre-model development. This phase includes everything that is done before an actual model that is meant to be used or further developed is made. For example, this may include identification of features,  best calibration approaches, wear locations, or comparison of model types. 

Phase 1 - Laboratory. This phase often includes structured activities in controlled conditions (e.g., activities for a per-specified amount of time).

Phase 2 - Semi-structured. This phase includes slightly more variability than Phase 1. Activities may take place in a more unstructured location (e.g., in a park instead of the lab) or participants may be free to choose the order or duration of activities.

Phase 3 - Free-living. This phase is more reflective of how the model would perform in the 'real world' as participants may be monitored during daily life or in unstructured settings (e.g., at home). Participants may be free to do whatever activities they want and/or go to any location they want.

Phase 4 - Independent sample. In this phase, a developed model is tested in a new, independent sample (i.e., different participants ideally in a different setting).  This provides the best indication of how the model will perform when used in new samples/studies.
