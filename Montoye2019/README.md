# Cross-validation and comparison of energy expenditure prediction models using count-based and raw accelerometer data in youth
### Montoye 2019
---

## Description
Six models were developed for predicting energy expenditure in children using either a right hip or left wrist-worn ActiGraph accelerometer or a combination of both monitors. Models were developed for raw acceleration data and count data separately. Models were trained using children playing active video games and walking/running on a treadmill and cross-validated in an independent sample of 15 participants who played active video games.

The following models are available. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is also provided.
* Artificial neural network for hip-worn monitor using count data (1.2 METs)
* Artificial neural network for hip-worn monitor using raw data (1.9 METs)
* Artificial neural network for wrist-worn monitor using count data (~2.2 METs*)
* Artificial neural network for wrist-worn monitor using raw data (3.4 METs)
* Artificial neural network for hip- and wrist-worn monitors (combined) using count data (~1.8 METs*)
* Artificial neural network for hip- and wrist-worn monitors (combined) using raw data (1.7 METs)

## Instructions
The [R code](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/code.R) can be used to read in a csv file with the necessary features and then use the chosen model to predict energy expenditure in METs for 15-sec windows. There is a separate file for each of the six models- the [hip count](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/hip_count.RData), [hip raw](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/hip_raw.RData), [wrist count](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/wrist_count.RData), [wrist raw](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/wrist_raw.RData), [combination count](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/combo_count.RData), and [combination raw](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/combo_raw.RData) models. There is an [example data](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/sample_data.csv) sheet with the variables described in the [data dictionary](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/datadictionary.csv) that need to be present in the csv file (this data sheet includes all wear locations and count/raw data). Further instructions are in the [R code.](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/main/Montoye2019/code.R)
This code relies on R software which can be downloaded for free at https://www.r-project.org/
