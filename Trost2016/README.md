# Decision trees for detection of activity intensity in youth with cerebral palsy
### Trost 2016

## Description
Two count-based decision trees are presented for classifying activity intensity of children with cerebral palsy wearing an ActiGraph at the hip. The average accuracy was 76.7-82.9% for vertical axis counts and 75.6-84.2% for vector magnitude counts.

## Development/Validation

|  |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| *Sample*  |51 (27 males) children with cerebral palsy, mean age was 12.4±3.3 years, 12.4±3.3 years, and 12.7±3.1 years for Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) 1, 2, and 3, respectively |
| *Setting*  |Not reported |
| *Activities*  |Activities of daily living, self-paced walking, stationary   |
| *Criterion* |Cosmed K4b2 (VO2)   |
| *Accelerometer(s)* |ActiGraph GT3X on right hip   |
| *Validation approach* |Leave-one-out cross-validation   |

## Instructions
Two decision trees were available- one for vertical axis counts/15-s and one for vector magnitude (square root of the sum of the squared counts in each axis) counts/15-s. Models also incorporate the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) rating of impairment.
