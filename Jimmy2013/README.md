## Description
Three methods are presented to predict energy expenditure, including an overall linear regression model, and a cubic 2-regression model and linear 2-regression model with separate equations for locomotor and play activities. The models were developed in children in the laboratory and cross-validated in a holdout sample. The Spearman rho was 0.85, 0.83, and 0.85 for the overall regression, cubic 2-regression, and linear 2-regression, respectively. Mean bias was 0.23, -0.17, -0.11 METs for the overall regression, cubic 2-regression, and linear 2-regression, respectively.

## Instructions
Three methods are provided to predict METs. In all methods, accelerometer data were in 5-s epochs. For the two 2-regression methods, horizontal counts and steps are used to determine the equation to use (locomotor or play activities) according to the decision tree below. Horizontal counts refers to counts in the horizontal vector, calculated as square root of the sum of the squared counts in the y- and z-axis. Importantly, the paper refers to the axes as x (vertical), y (left-right), and z (back-front).
