## Description
Smartphone accelerometers were used to predict total energy expenditure in adults. Percent error was 14.1 (compared to Sensewear) to 15.0% (compared to Actiheart).

## Instructions
Acceleration was collected using a smartphone. While a low pass filter to reduce noise was used, more information about this was not reported. Total energy expenditure (TEE) is estimated using the following function.
