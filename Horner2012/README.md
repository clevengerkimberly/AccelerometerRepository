# Development of an accelerometer-based multivariate model to predict free-living energy expenditure in a large military cohort
### Horner 2012

## Description
Models for predicting total energy expenditure (TEE) and physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) were created separately for males and females wearing a 3dnx on their lower back during free-living. Participants were from military cohorts in the UK. Coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.65 for TEE and 0.41 for PAEE.

## Instructions
Models are provided for TEE and PAEE separately for males and females. Input variables include weight, height, and 3dnx counts/day.
