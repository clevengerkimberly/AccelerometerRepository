# Predicting energy expenditure of manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury using a multisensor-based activity monitor
### Hiremath 2012

## Description
Two methods are presented for predicting METs of manual wheelchair users- a general prediction equation and a set of four activity-specific regression equations. Mean absolute error in kcal/min across activities was 0.3 to 1.3 for the general model and 0.2 to 0.9 for the activity-specific models. Intraclass correlations were 0.72 and 0.86 for the general and activity-specific models, respectively.
