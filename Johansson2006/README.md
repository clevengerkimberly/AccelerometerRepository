# Accelerometry combined with heart rate telemetry in the assessment of total energy expenditure
### Johansson 2006

## Description
Heart rate and ActiGraph counts are used in a branched equation model to predict energy expenditure in adults wearing a ActiGraph on the lower back. An overall equation for combining predictions from branched equations is also provided to estimate total energy expenditure. Individual calibration is needed to determine specific slopes and cut-offs for each participant.
