## Description
Cut-points for Euclidean norm minus one (ENMO) per 5-sec for monitors worn at the hip and each wrist developed and cross-validated in older adults (≥70 years of age). Across wear locations, sensitivity and specificity were 61-80% and 64-83%.

## Instructions
ENMO per 5-sec is calculated as square root of the sum of the squared acceleration in each axis, minus one, with negative values rounded up to zero. Below are the developed cut-points. You can also use the R package GGIR to calculate ENMO and apply these cut-points.
