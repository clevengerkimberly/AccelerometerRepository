# Estimation of daily energy expenditure in pregnant and non-pregnant women using a wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer
### van Hees 2011

## Description
Prediction equations for energy expenditure are determined for pregnant women and non-pregnant women wearing a GENEA on the wrist and non-dominant hip. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.68 to 1.03 MJ/day, bias was -0.01 to 0.02 MJ/day, and the coefficient of determination (R2) was -0.03 to 0.26.

## Instructions
Acceleration data were filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth band pass filter (0.2–15 Hz). Vector magnitude was calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared acceleration values in each axis and averaged over intervals of one second. Prediction equations for MJ/day are provided separately for pregnant and non-pregnant women.
