## Description
Thresholds for activity intensity are presented in a small sample of participants.

## Phase Designation
[What's this?](https://github.com/clevengerkimberly/AccelerometerRepository/blob/a76916ebe2a6002b20cdc6ef39c889d62ce9d6ae/phase%20_images/phase.md)
This model is in Phase 0.

## Instructions
Acceleration (g) in each axis is summated after every 10 values and then a cumulative sum is calculated for all three axes. Used thresholds to differentiate inactivity (<2 g), underactivity (>2 but <4 g), overactivity (>4 but <8 g), and hyperactivity (>8 g).
